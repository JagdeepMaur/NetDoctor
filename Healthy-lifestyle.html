        <div class="collapse" id="collapseExample1">
          <div class="card-body px-3">
            Indian cuisine has offered the world innumerable gastronomic greats — and shaped my kitchen in particular. From butter chicken to rogan josh to biryani, there are plenty of delicious Indian dishes to spice up one’s palate.

The ingredients and styles of cooking in Indian cuisine vary based on region, season, religion, and family tradition.

You can find everything from meat-based curries to vegetarian and vegan dishes, as well as an assortment of spices and ingredients that give each dish its distinct flavor profile.

India’s food culture has evolved through substantial interactions with neighboring Persia, ancient Greece, and the Middle East, responding to centuries of cross-cultural exchange.

The resulting dishes are renowned for their rich, spicy flavors and complex aromas. However, the cuisine isn’t just about taste — dishes across the Indian subcontinent are packed with nutrients, meaning they’re also very healthy options.

Here are 8 delicious and nourishing Indian dishes to try.

<strong><h2><br>1–2. Breakfast</h2></strong>
<strong><h4>1. Chilla</h4></strong>
<img src="Images/chilla.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="...">
<br><br>
Chillas are a savory Indian dish closely resembling pancakes. They are infused with spices and served with Indian pickles, sour cream, or plain yogurt. Chillas can also be adorned with chopped cucumber and tomatoes, but they’re just as good on their own.

Chillas are usually prepared with chickpea flour (besan) but can also be made out of sprouted mung beans.

Mung beans are a legume that’s eaten worldwide but especially in Asian countries.

Besides being a rich source of plant-based protein, mung beans contain a variety of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that have been shown to combat diseases such as diabetes. Test-tube studies suggest that they may provide anticancer benefits as well.

All the same, more human studies are needed.
<br><br>
<strong><h4>2. Poha</h4></strong>
<img src="Images/poha.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="...">
<br><br>
A popular Indian breakfast dish, poha is made of flattened, flaked rice that’s soaked in water and then tempered in onions and a medley of spices.

When topped with peanuts and peas, it has a delightful texture.

These add-ins boost the nutritional value of the dish, providing calcium and iron alongside fiber and protein, which may help you feel full longer.
    
<br><br>
<strong><h2>3–6. Lunch and dinner</h2></strong>

<strong><h4>3. Chole Masala</h4></strong>
<img src="Images/chole-masala.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="...">
<br><br>
Chole masala is an Indian dish primarily made of chickpeas simmered in spiced tomato sauce.

It pairs beautifully with roti (Indian flatbread), bhatura (deep-fried puffed bread), or naan (Indian flatbread typically cooked in a clay oven).

The word “masala” means “spice mix.” Spices such as cumin, garlic powder, chili flakes, turmeric, coriander seeds, and black peppercorns typically make an appearance in chole masala.

Like other types of legumes, chickpeas are high in protein. They provide substantial amounts of eight of the nine essential amino acids, which are the building blocks of protein. This means they’re a solid pick for vegetarian diets.

Along with numerous vitamins and minerals, chickpeas offer a significant portion of heart-healthy fiber. Studies have found that people with or without diabetes who eat more chickpeas are less likely to develop heart disease.
<br><br>
<strong><h4>Daal</h4></strong>
<img src="Images/dal.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="...">
<br><br>
Perhaps the heartiest of Indian dishes, daal is a fragrant lentil curry flavored with cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, garam masala, and other spices.

Daal can be made with a variety of lentils, such as toor daal (split pigeon peas), masoor daal (red lentils), and chana daal (chickpeas). Traditionally, it’s eaten with rice, naan, or roti. It can be served with Indian vegetables and enjoyed as a soup.

For vegetarians, daal can form the basis of a high protein meal.

Compared with other legumes, lentils have the highest insoluble fiber content, as well as high quantities of prebiotic carbohydrates.

Insoluble fiber passes through your gut undigested to help promote bowel regularity. And prebiotic carbs support the growth of gut-friendly probiotics, which may be beneficial for mental health.

That’s because the gut and brain communicate closely, forming the “gut-brain axis.” Notably, gut bacteria may increase the production of mood-enhancing brain chemicals such as dopamine and serotonin.
<br><br>
<strong><h4>5. Alleppey fish curry</h4></strong>
<img src="Images/alleppey-fish-curry.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="...">
<br><br>
Prepared with tender fish, zesty spices, and creamy coconut milk, Alleppey fish curry is a popular Indian dish that brims with sweet and sour flavors.

It comes from the Alleppey District of the Indian state of Kerala, which is known for its delightfully fragrant fish curries. The type of fish is most often Indian mackerel or kingfish, and it’s typically enriched with tamarind or green mangoes.

Numerous studies link fish intake to heart health.

According to one review, people who eat fish multiple times per week have a reduced risk of death from heart disease. Similarly, a review of 24 studies in 714,526 people associated eating non-fried fish with a reduced risk of heart disease.
<br><br>
<strong><h4>6. Jalfrezi</h4></strong>
<img src="Images/jalfrezi.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="...">
<br><br>
The fragrant spices and flavors of India are encapsulated in jalfrezi, a currylike stir-fry known for its many variations. Indeed, cooks from across the world have their own versions of this dish.

Jalfrezi incorporates protein such as chicken or shrimp alongside bell peppers, onions, and tomatoes. Ginger gives it an aromatic flavor, and cloves, cumin, and chiles add a kick that leaves your mouth watering with each bite.

Bell peppers are one of the richest sources of vitamin C, which is essential for several bodily processes, including collagen synthesis and iron absorption.

This vitamin is also a powerful antioxidant that helps protect your cells from unstable molecules called free radicals and helps maintain immune health 

<br><br>
<strong><h2>7–8. Sides</h2></strong>
<strong><h4>7. Masala bhindi</h4></strong>
<img src="Images/masala-bhindi.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="...">
<br><br>
Masala bhindi is a mouthwatering Indian side dish. The star ingredient is okra, which is called “bhindi” in Hindi.

It’s prepared in a spicy tomato-based sauce and served with roti or naan.

Okra is high in dietary fiber, which is associated with better blood sugar control. In particular, eating high fiber foods is an important strategy for people who are managing diabetes.

While further research in humans is needed, one review suggests that okra has various antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which may be helpful in managing symptoms of metabolic syndrome.

Metabolic syndrome is a group of interrelated conditions such as increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and high cholesterol levels — all of which can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.
<br><br>

<strong><h4>8. Baingan bharta</h4></strong>
<img src="Images/baingan-bartha.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="...">
<br><br>
Baingan bharta is a thrill for the taste buds. It’s made from peeled, mashed eggplants that are oven-roasted or cooked on the stove and then added to a marvelously thick tomato sauce infused with spices such as turmeric and chile.

Turmeric is rich in curcumin, a compound known for its anti-inflammatory properties. In fact, curcumin has been shown to benefit people with inflammatory conditions such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and arthritis — though the exact mechanism is unclear.

Thus, further research in humans is needed.

        <div class="collapse" id="collapseExample2">
          <div class="card-body px-3">
            A healthy lifestyle keeps you fit, energetic and at reduced risk for disease. According to WHO, Healthy living is a way of living that helps you enjoy more aspects of your life. It is a way of living that lowers the risk of being seriously ill or dying early. Health is not just about avoiding a disease or illness.
            <br><br>
            A healthy lifestyle is important for everyone. When we look after our physical health, we feel better too – fitter, more relaxed and better able to cope with things. This is especially important when you have a mental illness.

There are lots of ways of being healthy that feel good as well as doing you good.

<br><br>
<h3><strong>Benefits of healthy living</strong></h3>

What you gain by living more healthily includes:
<br><br>
👉 feeling better mentally – regular exercise can lift your mood and help you feel better
<br><br>
👉 saving money – eating junk food, smoking, and drinking sugary drinks or alcohol are all expensive habits
<br><br>
👉 fewer health problems – living a healthier lifestyle means a lower risk of developing many illnesses
<br><br>
👉 taking control of your life – getting healthy helps you feel in control of your life.
<br><br>
<h3><strong>Getting healthy</strong></h3>
‘Healthy living’ means maintaining a healthy lifestyle and introducing habits that improve your health. It can be difficult to change old habits, but there are steps you can take to become healthier. An important first step is identifying less healthy habits and learning new, positive ones to replace them, such as:
<br><br>
👉 eating healthy foods and balanced meals
<br><br>
👉 sleeping well and managing stress
<br><br>
👉 practicing safe sex, drinking alcohol responsibly and not abusing drugs
<br><br>
👉 being physically active
<br><br>
👉 staying connected with others
<br><br>
👉 being aware of any health risks related to your illness and its treatment, and working with your doctor to monitor these and then take action
<br><br>
👉 taking responsibility for your overall health including having regular check-ups for your eyes and teeth.
<br><br>

<h3><strong>How to develop positive health habits</strong></h3>
The key to developing positive habits that you are more likely to keep is to:
<br><br>
<h4>Start slowly</h4>

<strong>👉 Change just one thing at a time -</strong> see the benefits that can come from eating more balanced meals or, exercising more or quitting smoking
<br><br>
<strong>👉 Make small changes –</strong> an achievable change is more likely to become a habit you keep.
<br><br>
<strong>👉 Go slowly –</strong> making a change gradually can be easier than all at once.
<br><br>
<strong>👉 Build on what you already do –</strong> for example, if you enjoy walking, try extending your usual route by a manageable amount. 
<br><br>
Remember, increasing or adding even one new health behaviour can make a big difference to your health.
<br><br>

<h4>Work around challenges</h4>
There are things you can do to manage any extra challenges related to your illness and it’s treatment – such as drowsiness, sugar cravings or lack of motivation. Steps you can take include:
<br><br>
👉 organise daily activities around side-effects of medication, for example, if you are drowsy in the morning, organise exercise for the afternoon.
<br><br>
👉 discuss things with your doctor – there may be another medication you can try, or ask for referral to a specialist such as a dietitian or psychologist for expert advice.
<br><br>
<h4>Staying healthy</h4>
Being healthy is about more than getting fit and feeling better, it’s about staying that way too. Tips to help you stay motivated include:
<br><br>
👉 schedule regular check ups with your doctor to monitor your progress and for that extra push you may need to keep going.
<br><br>
👉 reward yourself – feel good about developing healthier habits by rewarding yourself with something nice.
<br><br>
👉 overcome slip-ups – if you slip-up, be realistic and start again.
<br><br>
<h4>Finding Support</h4>
There are lots of ways to get the support you need to help stay healthy. An important step is ﬁnding a good GP (general practitioner) you are comfortable discussing your health with. Seeing the same GP each time means you can work together to manage your health and organise check-ups as needed.
<br><br>
Having someone else as a ‘support person’ can make all the difference in keeping up healthy habits. Talk with your friends, family, mental health program or case worker. Don’t forget other services in your area that you can draw on too.
